## About Me
Hi, I’m William Nguyen. I have loved technology since childhood, when I spent long hours playing video games and wondering how a single button press turned into an on-screen action. That curiosity nudged me toward my first lines of code and, eventually, toward a computer science major at the University of Illinois Chicago.

Now in my third year, I move comfortably between algorithms, systems programming, and everything in between. I enjoy untangling stubborn bugs and squeezing extra efficiency out of code as much as I once enjoyed beating the toughest bosses in Elden Ring for the first time. The feeling is the same: turning a hard problem into a solved one.

Looking ahead, I want to build software that matters — whether that means a web app, a video game, or a project I have yet to discover. I’m always ready to learn, collaborate, and take on the next challenge. If you are working on something exciting, let’s connect.
