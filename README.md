Hey there!ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m William, and for as long as I can remember, Iâ€™ve been fascinated by technology. Growing up, I spent countless hours playing video gamesâ€”not just for the fun of it, but because I was curious about how they worked. I wanted to understand what was happening behind the scenes, how inputs transformed into actions, and how everything came together seamlessly. That curiosity eventually led me to programming, and before I knew it, I was hooked on software development.

Now, Iâ€™m in my third year at the University of Illinois Chicago, majoring in Computer Science. Throughout my time here, Iâ€™ve explored a wide range of topics, from algorithms to system programming, and Iâ€™ve built projects that challenged me to think critically and creatively. I love problem-solving, whether itâ€™s optimizing code for efficiency or debugging an elusive issue.

Looking ahead, I want to use my skills to create impactful softwareâ€”whether thatâ€™s in web development, video games, or something I havenâ€™t even discovered yet. Iâ€™m always eager to learn, collaborate, and take on new challenges. If youâ€™re working on something exciting, Iâ€™d love to connect!
